# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 50, and the player has 5 chances to guess the correct number.

## How It Works

1. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 50.
2. The player is prompted to enter their guess.
3. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low.
4. The player has up to 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
5. If the player guesses the number correctly within 5 attempts, they win.
6. If the player does not guess the number within 5 attempts, they lose and the correct number is revealed.

## How to Run the Game

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Copy the game code into a Python file (e.g., `guessing_game.py`).
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.
5. Run the game by typing `python guessing_game.py` and press Enter.

Enjoy playing the number guessing game!
